Software Examples
Below you will find examples of my work.  Each of these have been chosen to show case my ability to design, create and deliver a program.

Stat Reporter - 
Stat Reporter was written to be a quick statistics program for my SWE 5001 course.  It ended up a bit over engineered.  The final version of StatReporter was able to write the reports to a txt file, and the course required built in test cases were removed.  Stat Reporter is not very impressive on its own, but it serves as the first "final" program that I wrote while in school, and serves as a sort of baseline for looking at how I have improved through school.

SmartWord - 
SmartWord is a text prediction program.  The idea is that a user will providea a previous example of their writing, and then SmartWord will use this to guess what they will type.  As the user inputs a letter, SmartWord will return 3 guesses.  If any of those 3 guesses are correct, SmartWord moves onto the next word.
Initially, focus was on delivering a working product.  Once this was done, focus was shifted to tuning the feedback system, working with different corpora to enhance guesses and other semi-voodoo like tweaks. The final accuracy for SwartWord was around 50%.  This means that, for the most part, SmartWord could guess the word after typing 2 letters.  This came at using quite a large amount of memory (for the library mostly). 
Features Include:
 - Trie based system of word guessing.
 - Ability to add unknown words to its dictionary as the user goes along
 - Can reward good guesses and punish bad guesses
 - Collection of corpora that can be used to enhance its guessing ability.  This occurs at varying degrees of success.

Writing Examples
The following is a quick list of reports and articles I have written.

AI Report - Bayesian Hierarchical Clustering
    Article written by Nicholas Lowring and Ryan Bomalaski that focuses on Bayesian Hierarchical Clustering.  The team was expected to review and understand a provided paper, and then find and discuss an open source example that is either identical to or closely related to the methods discussed in the paper.
    My responsibilities were to find, test and dissect a program related to our paper.  In searching, I found an implementation written in R and C call BHC.  I then tested the program, and presented the code to the class in a series of talks.
